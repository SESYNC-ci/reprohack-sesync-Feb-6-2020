We are all excited by the progress made by many authors to **make their papers reproducible by publishing associated code and data**. 

We know how challenging it can be so we **want to showcase the value of the practice**, both for original authors and as a learning experience for those who attempt to reproduce the work.

It's imperative to note that  **ReproHacks are by no means an attempt to criticise or discredit work**. We see reproduction as **beneficial scientific activity in itself**, with useful outcomes for authors and valuable learning experiences for the participants and the research community as a whole.

We are hoping to use this ReproHack as a learning opportunity - to learn about doing reproductions and to learn how our own work can benefit from this effort.


***

## **Please do these preliminary steps:**

### **[Nominate a paper by January 27](`r params$submission_url`)**

We invite you to nominate papers that have both associated **code** and **data** publicly available. The following are links to previous ReproHacks with proposed papers or other sources for possible papers; you are welcome to nominate off of those lists, or other papers, as well. Rachael and Kelly will confirm that all nominations have both data and code available, and then all participants will have the opportunity to vote on the paper we will work on.

```{r, echo = F, include=FALSE}
if(!is.null(params$registration_url)){
  cat(paste0("### [**REGISTER as a participant**](", params$registration_url, ")"))
}
```

Join us at the hack to **dig into exciting science**, learn more about **reproducibility**, working with **other people's code and data** and more!

## **On the day**

Come to SESYNC just like normal! We'll all work on this project for the day! It'll be great!

While this is not a Carpentries event, we are modeling it on Carpentries policies. As such the event is governed by the [Carpentries Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html) and you should read it before participating. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.



### **Participants**

#### **Introduction & Welcome** 

#### **1. Project review**

#### **2. Work on your project!**

Follow any instructions/documentation associated with the papers and try and reproduce the work. As you work through your paper, keep in mind the main points on which feedback to the authors will provided, **Reproducibility**, **Documentation** and **Reusability**. It might help to have a look at the [feedback form](`r params$feedback_url`) before you begin and keep notes during. Feel free to use the event hackpad for that.

Throughout the day we'll discuss progress and troubleshoot any sticking points. 

Should we finish reproducing our paper quickly, we might want to consider attempting to **replicate** the results, for example, if the code is in R consider translating the analysis to python and examining whether we are getting the same results. Such a contribution would be appropriate for publication in the **ReScience C** journal! Have a look at the journals [website](http://rescience.github.io/write/) for further details. 


#### **3. Leave feedback for the authors**

Please complete the [**Reproducibility feedback form**](`r params$feedback_url`). Please also remember to be kind and constructive. Reproducibilty is hard and all authors submitting their papers have been incredibly brave. Here's an [example](https://github.com/annakrystalli/write-ups/blob/master/assets/OpenCon_ReproHack%20feedback_form.pdf) of feedback to authors.


#### **4. Feedback to the group on your experiences**

#### **Closing Remarks**
