We are all excited by the progress made by many authors to **make their papers reproducible by publishing associated code and data**. 

We know how challenging it can be so we **want to showcase the value of the practice**, both for original authors and as a learning experience for those who attempt to reproduce the work.

It's imperative to note that  **ReproHacks are by no means an attempt to criticise or discredit work**. We see reproduction as **beneficial scientific activity in itself**, with useful outcomes for authors and valuable learning experiences for the participants and the research community as a whole.

We are hoping to use this ReproHack as a learning opportunity - to learn about doing reproductions and to learn how our own work can benefit from this effort.


***

## **Please do these preliminary steps:**

### **Nominate a paper by January 27**

We invite you to nominate papers that have both associated **code** and **data** publicly available. The following are links to previous ReproHacks with proposed papers or other sources for possible papers; you are welcome to nominate off of those lists, or other papers, as well. Rachael and Kelly will confirm that all nominations have both data and code available, and then all participants will have the opportunity to vote on the paper we will work on.

### **[Download and read the selected paper by February 6](`r params$selected_url`)**

We have selected a paper about climate change an potato blight that has published code and data publicly available.

**Climate change may have limited effect on global risk of potato late blight.**  
Sparks, A. H., Forbes, G. A, Hijmans, R. J., & Garrett K. A. (2014). Climate change may have limited effect on global risk of potato late blight. Global Change Biology, doi:10.1111/gcb.12587.

submitted for a previous ReproHack by Adam Sparks

**Why should we attempt to reproduce this paper?**
This is a two-for one. The repository contains code for companion papers, the model development and the model implementation and analysis. As the repository notes, some data are not freely available so I’ve made an effort to allow the paper to be replicated as best possible with what’s available.

We will **dig into exciting science**, learn more about **reproducibility**, and working with **other people's code and data**, see how we can improve the reproducibiliyt of our research process.  Hope you can join us!

## **On the day**

Come to SESYNC just like normal! We'll all work on this project for the day! It'll be great!

While this is not a Carpentries event, we are modeling it on Carpentries policies. As such the event is governed by the [Carpentries Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html) and you should read it before participating. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.



### **Agenda**

#### 0930 **Intro to Reproducibility** (Rachael B.)

 - Why reproduce research?
 - Anticipated hurdles to reproduction?
 - Goals for the day
 
#### 0945 **Intro to selected paper** (Kelly J.)

#### 1000 **Refresh/re-read paper**

#### 1015 **Discuss division of tasks**

#### 1030 **Start Reproducing!**
 
  - Follow any instructions/documentation associated with the papers and try and reproduce the work. As you work through your paper,  
    keep in mind the main points **Reproducibility**, **Documentation** and **Reusability**. It might help to have a look at this  
    [author feedback form](`r params$feedback_url`) before you begin and keep notes during.  
  
  - Throughout the day we'll discuss progress and troubleshoot any sticking points. 

#### 1215 **Lunch break**

#### 1315 **Touch base on progress**

#### 1330 **Resume work on reproduction**

  - Should we finish reproducing our paper quickly, we might want to consider attempting to **replicate** the results, for example,  
    if the code is in R consider translating the analysis to python and examining whether we are getting the same results. Such a  
    contribution would be appropriate for publication in the **ReScience C** journal! Have a look at the journals  
    [website](http://rescience.github.io/write/) for further details. 
    
  - Alternately, we could consider reproducing the companion paper to this selected paper.  

#### 1600 **Revisit hurdles, both anticipated and encountered**

#### 1615 **Revisit lessons learned**

  - Implications for your research future (both short and longer term)?
  
#### 1630 **Wrap up and conclusion**
